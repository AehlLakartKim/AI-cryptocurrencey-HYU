Our team collected 48 hours orderbook data pieces and we found that we misunderstood
the meaning of Level (Count) setting. The old orderbook pieces and the source code
uploaded on LMS are located in the file named 'Old Version Orderbook (48 hours)' and
the modified files with sample that is still working on are located in 'Modified 
Version Orderbook'.
